# Homework6

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of Homework6 is to implement a sparse numeric vector class and additional methods for arithmetic operators, mean, norm, and standardization.

## Installation

You can install the development version of Homework6 from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("bo-han05/Homework6")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(Homework6)
x <- as(c(0, 1, 0, 9), "sparse_numeric")

mean(x)
norm(x)
standardize(x)
```
